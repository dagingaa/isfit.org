<p>The main topic of ISFiT 2009 is peacebuilding. ISFiT 2009 looks upon peacebuilding as a long-term process which aims at establishing a stable and lasting peace, a peace which is more than absence of war. A process which builds solid foundations for peaceful developement and increases a societyâ€™s capasity to handle conflicts in a peaceful way. ISFiT 2009 understands peacebuilding as both a preventive and a reconstructive process. ISFiT 2009 wants to explore how a peaceful future can be buildt. By presenting a broad spectra of activities we wish to look at the diversity of peacebuilding. All our workshops are in various ways connected to the main topic.</p>
