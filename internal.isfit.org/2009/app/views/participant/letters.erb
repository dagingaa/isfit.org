			<p>Dear <%= participant.first_name + " " + participant.last_name %>, </p>
			<p>
				the International Student Festival in Trondheim (ISFiT) 2009 and the 
				ISFiT Foundation, hereby confirm that you are invited to participate 
				in ISFiT 2009, in workshop <%= participant.final_workshop %>: 
				<%= ws[participant.final_workshop] %>. The conference takes 
				place in Trondheim, Norway, from 20 February to 1 March 2009.
			</p>
			<p>
				ISFiT 2009 has received about 4300 applications from 149 nations. All 
				applications have gone through a thorough selection process, where 
				only the most motivated and dedicated students were selected. On 
				this basis you are one of the 450 students who we look forward to 
				meeting in February. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The title of ISFiT 2009 is «Building a Future». Our main topic is 
				peacebuilding. To build lasting peace is among the most fundamental 
				challenges the international society face today. ISFiT 2009 wants to 
				explore how a peaceful future can be built, and what role students 
				can play in this process. ISFiT is a meeting place where future 
				leaders are given a chance to be heard, establish networks and learn 
				from each other.
			</p>
			<p>
				ISFiT 2009 is able to provide travel support for only a few of the 
				participants. Those who are granted travel support will receive a 
				separate letter concerning this. Food and accommodation in Trondheim 
				is free of charge for the participants, and will be taken care of by 
				ISFiT. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The ISFiT Foundation consists of the Norwegian University of Science 
				and Technology (NTNU), Sør-Trøndelag University College (HiST), the 
				Student Society of Trondheim, “Studentsamskipnaden i Trondheim” (SiT), 
				Trondheim local authority and Sør-Trøndelag County Authority. 
				Representing the city of Trondheim and its institutions for higher 
				education, the ISFiT Foundation proudly welcomes you to Trondheim and 
				ISFiT 2009.
			</p>
			<p>
				We consider it most important that all those who are invited are able 
				to attend ISFiT 2009. We therefore hope that universities, companies 
				and embassies will do their best to help the selected participants. 
			</p>
			<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

			<p>Dear <%= participant.first_name + " " + participant.last_name %>, </p>
			<p>
				You have been granted travel support in the amount of USD 
				<%= participant.travel_assigned_amount %>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please note that the travel support will be refunded during the 
				festival in February 2009. You will be asked to present your ticket 
				stubs and travel receipts, so please do not throw these away. From 
				your application and our conducted research, this sum should help you 
				cover what you need for a round trip ticket from your home country to 
				Trondheim, Norway. Please note that the travel support does not cover 
				passport or visa expenses. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We would like you to find tickets directly to Værnes airport in 
				Trondheim. If you are only able to fly into Gardermoen airport in 
				Oslo, bus and train transportation to Trondheim will be arranged by 
				ISFiT. Whether you take ISFiT-transportation one-way or round trip, 
				it will cost you NOK 400 (approximately USD 65). More information on 
				travel options is available in the information brochure.
			</p>
			<p>
				An invitation email has been sent to you, where you have been given 
				access to your own personal profile at 
				https://www.isfit.org/participant. In this profile there is a scheme 
				regarding travel information. You must remember to fill in your 
				travel plans in this scheme by December 15th. If you fail to show us 
				some proof that you have started to plan your trip by this date, you 
				risk losing your travel support, as it might be given to someone else.
			</p>
			<p>
				Due to our limited funds, the majority of the travel support 
				applications have been rejected. For this reason, we kindly ask you 
				to be discrete towards other participants about your advantageous 
				situation.
			</p>
			<p>
				We wish you good luck planning your trip and look forward to see you 
				in Trondheim in February 2009. If you have further questions, please 
				contact us through your profile at https://www.isfit.org/participant. 
			</p>
			<p>Best regards,</p>
